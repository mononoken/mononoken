## About Me
I am a web developer that enjoys Ruby and JavaScript. I currently work at [DeepCast](https://deepcast.fm) as a full stack developer. I am also a lead on the developer team for [Homeward Tails](https://github.com/rubyforgood/homeward-tails) with [Ruby for Good](https://rubyforgood.org/).

In 2021, I began working through The Odin Project curriculum while working as a structural engineer. I continued through parts of it while hiking and camping through 22 national parks in 2022 using offline access to documentation and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Database_download). I completed the Ruby on Rails track in 2023, followed shortly by the React track.

School led me to love physics and architecture, so I previously pursued a career in structural engineering for 8 years. I designed hundreds of stairs, performed erection analysis on a couple stadiums, and designed steel connections for schools, hospitals, and conference centers throughout the country.
