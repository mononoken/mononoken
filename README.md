## About Me 
Hi! I'm Ken Maeshima. I reside in Seattle, WA.

Some things I'm currently into are: Contributing to open-source (check-out [rubyforgood/pet-rescue](https://github.com/rubyforgood/pet-rescue)!), meeting people that code (local meetups and confs), reading [fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial) and [code books](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), <nobr>re-rewatching</nobr> [The Expanse](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)>), getting some fresh air, playing [Dune Imperium](https://www.direwolfdigital.com/dune-imperium/), tinkering with my [Spintronics](https://upperstory.com/spintronics/) circuits, and working on my pet projects (right now it's [Fae Scribe](https://github.com/mononoken/fae-scribe)).

I formerly worked as a licensed structural engineer for <nobr>8 years</nobr>. After deciding to pursue a career in software engineering instead, I completed the <nobr>full-stack</nobr> curriculum by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). I did a large part of the curriculum while taking an <nobr>8 month</nobr> road trip with my wife, visiting 22 National Parks from Texas to Washington. After that, I have continued making projects, exploring more technologies, and looking for interesting opportunities to contribute to collaborative work. 

## I am currently working on:
- [rubyforgood/pet-rescue](https://github.com/rubyforgood/pet-rescue), an open-source project for matching pets with adopters (proud of [my authz pr](https://github.com/rubyforgood/pet-rescue/pull/466))
- [Fae Scribe](https://github.com/mononoken/fae-scribe), a note-taking app designed for tabletop RPG players.
- Reading [100 Go Mistakes and How to Avoid Them](https://www.manning.com/books/100-go-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them)
