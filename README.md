- 👋 Hi, I’m @mononoken
- 👀 I recently traveled and camped for most of 2022 from Texas to Washington. I stopped at most of the National Parks and some state parks on the way. I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, and storytelling in all forms of media. Some things I am consuming right now that I enjoy are The Expanse (TV), Hades (game), and Don Quixote (book).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Ruby via The Odin Project. I also have worked with Python a small amount.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning! 
- 📫 How to reach me ...
